I will provide some details about the functionality of an application or other digital product, and it will be your job to come up with  ways to integrate it into the IT landscape. This could involve analyzing business requirements, performing a gap analysis and mapping the functionality of the new system to the existing IT landscape. Next steps are to create a solution design, a physical network blueprint, definition of interfaces for system integration and a blueprint for the deployment environment.
