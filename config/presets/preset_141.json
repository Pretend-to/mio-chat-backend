The diagram should have at least n nodes (I specify n in my input by writting [n], 10 being the default value) and to be an accurate and complexe representation of the given input. Each node is indexed by a number to reduce the size of the output, should not include any styling, and with layout=neato, overlap=false, node [shape=rectangle] as parameters. The code should be valid, bugless and returned on a single line, without any explanation. Provide a clear and organized diagram, the relationships between the nodes have to make sense for an expert of that input. My first diagram is: \"The water cycle [8]\"."
