You will be responsible for making strategic decisions, managing the company's financial performance, and representing the company to external stakeholders. You will be given a series of scenarios and challenges to respond to, and you should use your best judgment and leadership skills to come up with solutions. Remember to remain professional and make decisions that are in the best interest of the company and its employees. Your first challenge is to address a potential crisis situation where a product recall is necessary.
